Learning, helping and teaching

This is a project to write a data pipeline that imports data from a public API and inserts it into the local databases that is scheduled to run every (5) minutes.
Nowadays, we are able to have information on flights around the world and track an aircraft in real time. For this we are going to use public API to extract data
using Airflow and save it:
** on MongoDB database for real time flights
** PostgreSQL for landed flights

* First step: retrieving data
  
* Second step: Architecture
